# DeepExtremeMixtureModel/data

This subdirectory contains data used in experiments.

## Overview

- *processed_data.pickle - This is the processed data.
- *rand_thresholds.pickle - Generating a large number of random thresholds to train the variable threshold DEMM turns out to be relatively slow so I did once and then randomly shuffle it during training to simulate generating new random thresholds.

The two .pickle files marked with an * are not included in this repository due to file size, but are available for download via Google Drive in a 400MB zip folder [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vy9h3uiarpwrFCGFgr9Ex81q2_1v0f34/view?usp=sharing).
